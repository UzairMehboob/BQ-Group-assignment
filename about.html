            <p>Valorant is a team-based first-person tactical hero shooter set in the near future.
                <sup>[4][5][6][7]</sup>
                Players play
                as one of a set of Agents, characters based on several countries and cultures around the world.
                <sup>[7]</sup> In the
                main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having
                five
                players on it. Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate
                ability
                that requires charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives. Every player starts each round with a
                "classic" pistol and one or more "signature ability" charges. <sup>[5]</sup> Other weapons and ability
                charges can be
                purchased using an in-game economic system that awards money based on the outcome of the previous round,
                any
                kills the player is responsible for, and any objectives completed. The game has an assortment of weapons
                including secondary guns like sidearms and primary guns like submachine guns, shotguns, machine guns,
                assault rifles and sniper rifles. <sup>[8][9]</sup> There are automatic and semi-automatic weapons that
                each
                have a
                unique shooting pattern that has to be controlled by the player to be able to shoot accurately.
                <sup>[9]</sup> It
                currently offers 23 agents to choose from. <sup>[3][10][11]</sup> The player will get 5 unlocked agents
                when
                they create
                their account, and will have to unlock the rest of the agents by collecting an in-game currency called
                Kingdom Credits. Kingdom Credits can be acquired by playing games or completing daily and weekly tasks,
                and
                can be spent on unlock new agents or cosmetic items. However, within the first 28 days of release, new
                Agents can only be unlocked with Valorant Points (VP), Agent Recruitment Events, or by having a linked
                and
                active Xbox Game Pass subscription. VP is an in-game currency that can only obtained by purchasing it
                with
                real money, <sup>[12]</sup>[better source needed] and it can be spent on cosmetic items or new agents.

            <hr><br>
            <p>n the Spike Rush mode, the match is played as best of 7 rounds - the first team to win 4 rounds wins the
                match. Players begin the round with all abilities fully charged except their ultimate, which charges
                twice
                as fast as in standard games. All players on the attacking team carry a spike, but only one spike may be
                activated per round. Guns are randomized in every round and every player begins with the same gun.
                Ultimate
                point orbs in the standard game are present, as well as multiple different power-up orbs.[15]</p><br>

            <p>Swiftplay matches are simply a shortened version of the Unrated game mode. 10 players are split into 2
                teams,
                attackers and defenders. Attackers must plant the spike while the Defenders must stop them. What differs
                Swiftplay to Unrated is that it is best to 9 rounds - the first team to win 5 rounds wins the match. On
                round 4, the team's players switch, as they would do in round 7 in the Unrated game mode. The game's
                currency system has no changes from Unrated. Swiftplay is meant as a quick game mode, averaging around
                15
                minutes per game, as opposed to around 40 minutes for Unrated. <sup>[16]</sup></p>

            <p>Premier is a 5v5 gamemode that allows players a path-to-pro competitive game mode that is aimed towards
                players that wish to be a professional player. Premier is currently in alpha testing in Brazil. Players
                will
                need to create a team of five to compete against other teams in divisions. Each season will last a few
                weeks
                and the top teams will be invited to compete in the Division Championship. This gamemode will include a
                pick-and-ban system for maps unlike all the other gamemodes where the players have to play the map
                selected
                by the system.</p><br>

            <p>The Deathmatch mode was introduced on August 5, 2020. 14 players enter a 9-minute
                free-for-all match and the first person to reach 40 kills or the player who has the most kills when time
                is

                disabled during the match which indulges pure gunplay. Green health packs drop on every kill, which
                reset
                the player to maximum health, armor, and give an additional 30 bullets to each of their guns.</p><br>

            <p>The Team Deathmatch gamemode was announced on June 15, 2023, and went live on June 27 with patch 7.0.
                This
                gamemode combines and borrows elements from the standard unrated mode as well as the regular deathmatch
                mode. It is a free-for-all gamemode where players are split into two teams with five players each. Each
                match lasts for 9 minutes and 30 seconds, and the first team that reaches 100 kills win. If neither team
                has
                reached 100 kills at the end of the 9.5 minutes, then the team with the most kills wins. Each match is
                split
                into four stages, with the weapon selection becoming progressively more powerful as players advance
                through
                the stages. Players are respawned in a spawn room after being killed. where they will be able to select
                and
                adjust their weapons loadout if needed. Unlike the regular deathmatch mode, players need to select their
                agents before the match begins, as agent abilities are allowed in this gamemode. Players can charge
                their
                agents' ultimate abilities either by acquiring Ultimate Orbs spawned randomly throughout the map, or by
                getting kills. Their ultimate abilities will be available for use after their ult percentages reach
                100%.
                Unlike all other gamemodes, this mode is not played on the standard maps, but rather on its own set of
                three
                maps that are specifically designed for team deathmatch: Piazza, District, and Kasbah</p><br>

            <hr>
            <p>Valorant was developed and published by Riot Games, the studio behind League of Legends.[33][7]
                Development
                started in 2014, within their research and development division.[4] Game director Joe Ziegler is
                credited
                with the initial idea of Valorant while formulating potential games with other Riot developers.[4] David
                Nottingham is the creative director for Valorant.[4] Trevor Romleski, former League of Legends's
                designer
                and Salvatore Garozzo, former professional player and map designer for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
                are
                its game designers.[34] Moby Francke, former Valve developer, who has been art and character designer
                for
                Half-Life 2 and Team Fortress 2, is the art director. <br>Riot chose to develop Valorant using Unreal
                Engine
                4, which the development team said would allow it to focus on gameplay and optimizations rather than
                spending time on core systems.[40][41] To meet the goal of a lower performance barrier so more people
                could
                play Valorant, the team set notably low minimum and recommended hardware requirements for the game. To
                reach
                30 frames per second on these small requirements, the game's engineering team, led by Marcus Reid, who
                previously worked on Gears of War 4, had to make several modifications to the engine. These
                modifications
                included editing the renderer using the engine's mobile rendering path as base, or reworking the game's
                lighting systems to fit the static lighting that tactical shooters often require, as to not interfere
                with
                gameplay.[40] Unreal's modern underpinnings also helped to solve many of the issues that Riot set out to
                solve from other games in the genre, and additional modifications helped to meet the game's other goal
                of
                creating a suitable competitive environment, including optimizing server performance by disabling
                character
                animations in non-combat situations and removing unnecessary evaluations in the hit registration
                process.[42][38][40] During development, Riot Games made promises to work towards a ping of less than 35
                milliseconds for at least 70% of the game's players.[43] To accomplish this, Riot promised 128-tick
                servers
                in or near most major cities in the world, as well as working with internet service providers to set up
                dedicated connections to those servers.[43] Due to the increase in internet traffic during the COVID-19
                pandemic, Riot has had trouble optimizing connections and ping to their promised levels.</p><br>

            <p>Valorant was teased under a tentative title Project A in October 2019.[46] It was announced on March 1,
                2020,
                with a gameplay video on YouTube called "The Round".[7][47][48] The closed beta of the game was launched
                on
                April 7, 2020.[46] For a chance to obtain a beta access key, players were required to sign up for
                accounts
                with both Riot Games and the streaming platform Twitch and watch related streams.[49] This beta ended on
                May
                28, 2020, with the game being fully released on June 2, 2020.[50] </p><br>
